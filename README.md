This repository is exploring the concepts and implementation of Domain Specific Languages (DSL), which are programming languages with a higher level of abstraction optimized for a specific class of problems, contrary to General-Purpose Languages. 

Through this code I am highlighting the mathematical logic behind DSLs, using such compiler aspects as specific grammars, finite automata and lexers/scanners.
